# SPICEprogram_2022

What is SPICE?
The Summer Program in Computational Psychiatry Education provides an opportunity for high-school and college students aged 16 and up to work alongside computational psychiatry researchers at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and assist in cutting-edge basic and clinical research. 


Program Overview
SPICE is a 8-week research program offered to high school and college students at the Center for Computational Psychiatry at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Prospective trainees should be independent, motivated, and inquistive and demonstrate a strong interest in psychiatric or neuroscience research. Over the course of the program, trainees will undergo a 2-week intensive lecture series about the basics of neuroscience, psychiatry, and computational sciences, and spend the remaining time completing a basic research project under the supervision of CCN graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and/or faculty.
